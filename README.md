# Weather-Dashboard

# Brief Description:

For this task assignment I was tasked with building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. To obtain the API for the weather data I used the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

When user searches for a city they are presented with current and future weather conditions for that city and the city is added to to the search history. When user searches city then they are presented with he city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. User is also presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
